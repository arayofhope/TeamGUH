This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

# Basic Setup
clone directory, cd into it, then run:
`npm install` followed by `npm run dev`
Website should be live on local dev server at `localport:3000` (simply paste into web address)

# Project Structure
From root directory: assets go into `public` folder, javascript files go under `pages` folder. `styles` folder contains the CSS framework file for handling CSS boilerplate. The actual index page is held within `pages/index.js`: HTML is written inline with React. You may make edits there.

# Current known issues:
Player profiles cause white screen (may be related to nested <div> issue)
